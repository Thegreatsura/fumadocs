title: Validate Links
description: Ensure your links are correct.
---

## Setup

You can use [`next-validate-link`](https://next-validate-link.vercel.app) to validate your links in content files.

> This guide is mainly for **Fumadocs MDX**, see the docs of `next-validate-link` for other setups.

Create a script for Bun:

<include meta='title="./scripts/lint.ts"'>./validate-links.example.ts</include>

### Running Lint

To access the `source` object outside of app runtime, you'll need a runtime loader:

```toml tab="bunfig.toml"
preload = ["./scripts/preload.ts"]
```

```ts tab="scripts/preload.ts"
import { createMdxPlugin } from 'fumadocs-mdx/bun';

Bun.plugin(createMdxPlugin());
```

Run the script to validate links:

```bash
bun ./scripts/lint.ts
```
