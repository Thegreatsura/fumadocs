| **Docs Page** | All content of the page.                                |
| **TOC**       | Navigation within the article.                          |

## Customisation

### Layouts

You can use the exposed options of different components:

<DocsCategory slugs={['ui', 'layouts', 'home-layout']} />

#### Sidebar Items

Navigation elements like sidebar take a [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree) to render navigation links, it's a tree that describes all available pages and folders.

Normally, the tree (sidebar items) is generated from your file structure, you can learn [how to customise it](/docs/ui/page-conventions).

### Components

Fumadocs UI also offers styled components for interactive examples to enhance your docs, you can customise them with exposed props like `style` and `className`.

See [Components](/docs/ui/components).

### Design System

Since the design system is built on Tailwind CSS, you can customise it [with CSS Variables](/docs/ui/theme#colors).

### CLI

If none of them suits you, Fumadocs CLI is a tool to install Fumadocs UI components and layouts to your codebase, similar to Shadcn UI. Allowing you to fully customise Fumadocs UI:

```package-install
npx fumadocs add
```
