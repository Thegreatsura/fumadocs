description: Fumadocs MDX loader integration.

## Introduction

By default, Fumadocs MDX requires a bundler to work.

When you are accessing your content without a bundler, such as:

- A script executed by Node.js or Bun.
- **Config files:** config files like `react-router.config.ts` are executed without a bundler.
- Any unbundled environment.

You will need a runtime loader. See below for available loader integrations.
